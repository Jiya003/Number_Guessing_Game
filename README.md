Number Guessing Game

Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! This is a simple and engaging Python game where you challenge yourself to guess a randomly chosen number within a specified range.

Description
In this game, the computer selects a random number between 0 and 100. You have 10 attempts to guess this number. With each guess, you receive feedback indicating whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct. Use this feedback to adjust your guesses and try to identify the hidden number within the allowed attempts.

Features
Random Number Generation: The game selects a random number between 0 and 100.
Guess Feedback: After each guess, you'll be informed if the number is too high or too low.
Attempt Tracking: You start with 10 guesses. Each incorrect guess reduces the number of remaining attempts.
Game End Conditions: The game ends when you either guess the number correctly or run out of guesses.

How to Play
Run the Python script.
Enter your guess as an integer between 0 and 100.
Based on the feedback, adjust your subsequent guesses.
Continue guessing until you either find the correct number or exhaust your 10 guesses.
